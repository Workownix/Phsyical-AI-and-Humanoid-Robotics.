## 🤖 Welcome to the Future of AI Education

**Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** is a revolutionary course that takes AI beyond screens and into the real world. Experience firsthand how artificial intelligence comes alive when combined with physical form and motion.

> *"The future of work will be a partnership between people, intelligent agents (AI software), and robots."*

### Why Physical AI Matters
Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.
