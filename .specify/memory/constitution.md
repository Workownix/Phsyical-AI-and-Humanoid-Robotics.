# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Docusaurus Compatibility
The textbook MUST be written in Docusaurus classic template, using only Markdown + MDX in the `docs/` folder.

### II. Structured Content
Content MUST follow a proper sidebar structure with modules and weekly breakdowns as defined in `Hackathon.md`.

### III. Technical Accuracy and Teachability
Every chapter MUST be technically accurate, educational, and suitable for advanced AI students.

### IV. Code Integration
Relevant code blocks (ROS 2, Python, URDF, etc.) MUST be included in chapters where applicable to enhance learning.

### V. Content Fidelity
All hardware tables, weekly breakdowns, and learning outcomes MUST exactly match the content of `Hackathon.md`.

### VI. Professional and Exciting Tone
The tone of the textbook MUST be professional yet exciting, reflecting the future of humanoid robotics.

## Target Audience

The target reader is advanced AI students who want to build real humanoid robots.

## Content Requirements

Chapters MUST be technical, accurate, and teachable.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other documentation. Amendments require thorough documentation, cross-functional approval, and a clear migration plan. Compliance will be reviewed regularly.
