# Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2

## Overview of Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI, which operates in digital spaces, to AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. This capstone course introduces students to Physical AI—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

- Focus: Middleware for robot control.
- Core concepts: ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services.
- Integration: Bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers using rclpy.
- Understanding: URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids.

## Foundations of Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence

Physical AI systems are designed to interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators. These systems must understand physical laws, spatial relationships, and material properties to function effectively. Unlike traditional AI that operates purely in digital environments, Physical AI bridges the gap between the digital brain and the physical body.

### From Digital AI to Robots that Understand Physical Laws

The transition from digital AI to Physical AI involves several critical considerations:

- **Physics Understanding**: Robots must operate according to real-world physical constraints
- **Sensor Integration**: Multiple sensors working in coordination (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs)
- **Real-time Processing**: Decisions must be made within physical constraints
- **Safety Considerations**: Physical systems must operate safely in human environments

## Overview of the Humanoid Robotics Landscape

Humanoid robotics is a specialized field that focuses on creating robots with human-like characteristics and capabilities. This includes:

- **Biomechanical Design**: Mimicking human movement patterns
- **Natural Interaction**: Capabilities for natural human-robot interaction
- **Adaptive Learning**: Systems that learn from human behavior
- **Bipedal Locomotion**: Walking on two legs with balance maintenance

## Sensor Systems in Robotics

Robots rely on various sensors to perceive and interact with their environment:

### LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)
- Provides 360-degree distance measurements
- Essential for navigation and obstacle detection
- Creates detailed point cloud maps of the environment

### Cameras
- Visual perception and object recognition
- Stereo vision for depth perception
- RGB-D cameras combine color and depth data

### IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units)
- Measure acceleration and angular velocity
- Critical for balance control in humanoid robots
- Provide orientation data in real-time

### Force/Torque Sensors
- Measure forces applied to robot limbs
- Essential for safe human-robot interaction
- Enable compliant control for manipulation tasks
