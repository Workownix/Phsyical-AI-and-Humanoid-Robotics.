# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

### Quarter Overview

- Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
  Focus: The convergence of LLMs and Robotics.
  Voice-to-Action: Using OpenAI Whisper for voice commands.
  Cognitive Planning: Using LLMs to translate natural language ("Clean the room") into a sequence of ROS 2 actions.
  Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid. A final project where a simulated robot receives a voice command, plans a path, navigates obstacles, identifies an object using computer vision, and manipulates it.

## Warning Boxes

:::caution Ethical Considerations of VLA Systems
-   **Bias**: VLA models can inherit and amplify biases present in their training data, leading to discriminatory or unfair robot behaviors.
-   **Misuse**: The ability of robots to understand and execute complex natural language commands raises concerns about potential misuse in unsupervised or malicious contexts.
-   **Transparency and Explainability**: It can be challenging to understand why a VLA system makes certain decisions, which is crucial for debugging, safety, and accountability.
-   **Human-Robot Trust**: Over-reliance or misplaced trust in VLA-powered robots could lead to dangerous situations if the robot's capabilities are misunderstood or overestimated.
