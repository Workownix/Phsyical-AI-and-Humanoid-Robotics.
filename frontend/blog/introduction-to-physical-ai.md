# Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from digital intelligence to embodied intelligence. Unlike traditional AI that operates in virtual spaces, Physical AI systems function in the real world, understanding and manipulating physical objects and environments.

## What is Embodied Intelligence?

Embodied intelligence refers to AI systems that interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators. These systems must understand physical laws, spatial relationships, and material properties to function effectively.

## The Robotics Stack

Modern robotics requires integration across multiple layers:

- **Perception**: Understanding the environment through sensors
- **Planning**: Deciding what actions to take
- **Control**: Executing precise motor commands
- **Learning**: Adapting to new situations and improving over time

Stay tuned for deeper dives into each of these components!
